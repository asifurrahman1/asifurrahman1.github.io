               <h3>Safe Reinforcement Learning </h3>
             <p> 
              Current safe reinforcement learning techniques tend to restrict exploration to ensure safety, which is counterproductive to the natural exploration-exploitation learning mechanism of reinforcement learning. 
              In this research, we explored a new direction for safe RL, where safety is learned as a behavior that excludes behaviors responsible for most safety violations. Our current findings indicates this approch very promising.
              We are now extending this work to multi-agent system and planning to cover POMDP and IMDPs.
